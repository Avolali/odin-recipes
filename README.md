In this project I am building a basic recipe website using my basic knowledge of creating a boiler plate in HTML, creating the headings and relative links to the 3 recipe pages with images and a description of the recipe and unordered lists of ingredients and ordered lists of the steps. 
UPDATE: 
With my basic knowledge of CSS I've updated the webpages using different fonts, colors and some other layout adjustments.
